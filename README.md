For this assignment, I had to act as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. My goal is to help the school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The first part summarizes the district information and the second part has to do with individual school information.

One conclusion that I drew from this analysis was that the charter schools were by far the best performers. When I sorted the data to have the top five schools based on % Overall Passing I found that charter schools topped the top five list. When I did the opposite to find the worst performing schools I found that they were all district schools.

Another conclusion that I found interesting was the relation between Per Student Budget and Scores/Overall Passing. One would think that the more you spend per student would result in more success, but the opposite proved true. The less that was spent on an individual student resulted in high overall passing percentages. Also, it seemed that school size was a determining factor in the success of students. The small and medium-sized schools had nearly the same overall passing percentage at 89% and 90% respectively. Large schools between 2000-5000 students had a 58% overall passing percentage.

My suggestion would be to not pour more money into schools where students are experiencing less success because the schools getting less money per student are having more success. The biggest factor is the number of students in these schools. It could be said that because the larger schools are more stretched due to the number of students they aren't getting as much help as they could be getting to achieve success. The district might have to be remapped to level out the number of students at each school. Another suggestion could be to hire more staff at these larger schools to lower the number of students per class.
